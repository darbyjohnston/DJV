Features include:
* Support for high resolution and high bit depth images
* A/B comparison with wipe, overlay, and difference modes
* Timeline support with OpenTimelineIO
* Color management with OpenColorIO
* Multi-track audio with variable speed and reverse playback
* Experimental support for USD files
* Available for Linux, macOS, and Windows

DJV is built with the [tlRender](https://github.com/grizzlypeak3d/tlRender) and
[feather-tk](https://github.com/grizzlypeak3d/feather-tk) libraries.
