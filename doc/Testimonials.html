<p>In 2010, I worked on my first 4K in color grading and printing to film. I
was not able to do it if DJV view doesn't exist to check final picture in DPX.
In this time, the max playback rate was about 13/fps. In 2015, I can playback
with this very great tool 4K cinema ( 4096x2304 ) @ 25/fps on a true 4K display.
I built my workflow with DJV view in a very important function : It makes me
able to check the final image that will be encoded in DCP with normal playback.
Thank you very much to the author.</p>

<p>At GPS we use more involved solutions for advanced and remote client reviews
and dailies but there's a lot to be said about a small lightweight frame viewer.
And DJV does a great job at it. The fact that is open source, with a full set
of codec libraries, portable and fully cross-platform makes a very easy
decision when adopting it as a default tool for artists to review their work
with. Its command-line implementation made it seamless to integrate it with our
pipeline. We have it integrated in our main proprietary software hub and
through it we have also embedded DJV inside other 2D and 3D solutions we use.</p>

<p>The DJV Imaging suite of tools are the backbone of our transcoding pipeline.
Hundreds of input plates and renders pass through DJV in our facility on a
weekly basis without a hitch. The DJV suite of tools also integrate nicely
throughout our scripting pipeline making it easy to build custom tools for our
producers, artists and supervisors for publishing dailies, transcoding and
reviewing footage. I am constantly amazed at its performance and value in our
pipeline. If you're looking for a way to improve your pipeline DJV imaging
should be a top consideration.</p>

<p>DJV is the first viewer in our studio that 'just worked' on all platforms.
Your focus on stability and ease of use made adopting DJV as our primary viewer
an easy decision.</p>

<p>We use DJV Viewer here at Frantic Films for playing flipbooks, QuickTimes,
and raw 2k+ renders across the network. It has a nice uncluttered UI,
customizable keys, and its robust tools have fantastic options for anyone
needing a strong RAM player. It's ability to write out proxy footage is a
valuable tool and it allows us to quickly get artists up and running precomps
or doing matchmoves. I'd have to give this program an 11 out of 10 for
usability.</p>

<p>I would like to thank you for the excellent DJV image viewing application
you have developed. The quality of this product, combined with your willingness
to implement new features and the speed in which you implement these features
has made this an indispensable tool in our QA pipeline. This application easily
rivals other commercial tools.</p>
