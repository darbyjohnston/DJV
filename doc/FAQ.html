<h2><a name="1">Is DJV free?</a></h2>
<hr>
<div class="block">
<p>The DJV source code is covered by an open source BSD style license which
means that it is basically free to use, modify, and distribute, as long as the
copyright notices and license are retained. See the <a href="Legal.html">legal</a>
page for additional information.</p>
<p>Note that some of the third party software that DJV depends on may have
different licensing requirements, see the <a href="Legal.html">legal</a> page
for additional details.</p>
</div>

<h2><a name="2">How do I setup the DJV command line tools on OS X?</a></h2>
<hr>
<div class="block">
<p>If you installed DJV to the Applications folder you can add the command line
tools to your path:</p>
<pre>
> export PATH=$PATH:/Applications/djv-1.2.2-OSX-x64.app/Contents/Resources/bin
</pre>
<p>You will also need to setup the library path:</p>
<pre>
> export DYLD_FALLBACK_LIBRARY_PATH=/Applications/djv-1.2.2-OSX-x64.app/Contents/Resources/lib
</pre>
<p>Both of these commands can be added to your shell startup file ($HOME/.profile)
so they are called automatically.</p>
</div>

<h2><a name="3">How do I use a LUT (lookup table) with the DJV viewer?</a></h2>
<hr>
<div class="block">
<p>You can find information about using LUTs on the
<a href="djv_view.html#ColorAndDisplayProfiles">color and display profiles</a> page.</p>
</div>

<h2><a name="4">Are 3D LUTs supported?</a></h2>
<hr>
<div class="block">
<p>3D LUTs are not currently supported.</p>
</div>

<h2><a name="5">How can I convert an image sequence to a movie (or vice versa)?</a></h2>
<hr>
<div class="block">
<p>To convert an image sequence or movie you can use either the <a href="djv_view.html#SavingFiles">djv_view</a>
application or the <a href="djv_convert.html">djv_convert</a> command line tool.</p>
<p>Here is an example of using the djv_convert command line tool:</p>
<pre>
> djv_convert input.1-100.sgi output.mp4
</pre>
</div>

<h2><a name="6">What image and movie file formats are supported?</a></h2>
<hr>
<div class="block">
<p>You can find information about the supported file formats on this
<a href="ImageFileFormats.html">page</a>/</p>
</div>

<h2><a name="7">How can I enable timecode display?</a></h2>
<hr>
<div class="block">
<p>Open the preferences dialog from the "File" menu and click on "Time".
Set the time units to "Timecode".</p>
